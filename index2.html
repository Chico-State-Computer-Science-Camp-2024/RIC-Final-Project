    <h3>
        Sometime during the 60th election, aliens from the planet Pinpon invaded our<br>
        country. After violently disintegrating both candidates live on Kimmy Jimmel’s late<br>
        night show, they decided that any American’s social status will be determined by <br>
        their skill in the game of table tennis and it will be the only legal way of winning an<br>
        argument. Naturally, people don’t care and keep performing so called “tik tok <br>
        dances” or immersing themselves in braincell-deleting content.<br>
        The next day, in the deadly heat of Chico California, two table tennis tryhards Pizi and<br>
        Jigob plan to overthrow their summer camp using these new laws. <br>
        It’s now time for you to accompany these two on their journey where only the winner<br>
        will stay on.
